# UnconventionalContributors
We have a diverse range of contributors in the open source community who make contributions in unconventional ways without using any coding or developing expertise, some ways we hear quite often, some not so much. This high-level instructional interview series should be beneficial to anyone who wants to start contributing to open source.

One such forum is the *[UnconventionalContributors](https://www.parthgoswami.com/categories/unconventionalcontributors/)* series, which is designed for aspiring and emerging contributors to get involved with open source communities.
